- sum of seven first integers = 28
- sum of seven first squares = 140 = 5.28
- sum of seven first cubes = 784 = 28.28
- sum of seven first fourth powers = 4676 = 28.167
Exo 24:3 = 4676 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.
- sum of seven first fifth powers = 29008 = 28 x 1036 = 28.28.37

{ pi und e

  Product of letter values x Number of letters
  --------------------------------------------   = pi (1mo-1-1) oder e (joh-1-1)
  Product of word values x Number of words


  P(G) = 3.1415545… x 10^17
  pi   = 3.1415926… 

       => An approximation of pi to 4 decimal places, discounting
          the 17 zeros after the decimal point. Error about 1 part
          in 100,000.

  E(J) = 2.71831282… x 10^40
  e    = 2.71828182…

       => An approximation of e to 3 decimal places, discounting
          the 40 zeros after the decimal point. Error again about 1
          part in 100,000


      However, one is an underestimate (pi) and the other an
      overestimate (e). When they are summed the errors almost
      completely cancel out.
      P(G) + E(J) = 5.85986732 
      pi   + e    = 5.85987448

        => The error is now reduced to about 1 part in 800,000.
  
  
  The interaction of light with matter is governed by alpha.

     alpha = 7.29735257 x 10^-3
     

  (27013627)^2 = 7.29736043 … x 10^14

   If we now sum the significant digits of all three estimates:
      31415545 . . . + 27183128 . . . + 72973604 . . . = 1315722776

   and compare with the true sum of 1315722705
